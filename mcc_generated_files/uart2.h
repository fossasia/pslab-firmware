  @Description
    This type specifies the status of the hardware receive or transmit.
    More than one of these values may be OR'd together to create a complete
    status value.  To test a value of this type, the bit of interest must be
    AND'ed with value and checked to see if the result is non-zero.

    UART2_Initialize() function should have been called

    So the recieve status should be checked to see
    if the receiver is not empty before calling this function.

  @Preconditions
    UART2_Initialize() function should have been called
    before calling this function. The transfer status should be checked to see
    if transmitter is not busy before calling this function.

  @Param

/**
  @Summary
    Returns the transmitter and receiver status

  @Description
    This returns the transmitter and receiver status. The returned status may 
    contain a value with more than one of the bits
    specified in the UART2_STATUS enumeration set.  
    The caller should perform an "AND" with the bit of interest and verify if the
    result is non-zero (as shown in the example) to verify the desired status
    bit.

  @Preconditions
    UART2_Initializer function should have been called 
    before calling this function

  @Param
    None.

  @Returns
    A UART2_STATUS value describing the current status 
    of the transfer.

  @Example
    <code>
        while(!(UART2_StatusGet & UART2_TX_COMPLETE ))
        {
           // Wait for the tranmission to complete
        }
