        This type specifies the status of the hardware receive or transmit.
        More than one of these values may be OR'd together to create a complete
        status value.  To test a value of this type, the bit of interest must be
        AND'ed with value and checked to see if the result is non-zero.

        UART1_Initialize() function should have been called
        before calling this function. This is a blocking function.
        So the recieve status should be checked to see
        if the receiver is not empty before calling this function.

       UART1_Initialize() function should have been called

      @Summary
        Returns the transmitter and receiver status

      @Description
        This returns the transmitter and receiver status. The returned status may 
        contain a value with more than one of the bits
        specified in the UART1_STATUS enumeration set.  
        The caller should perform an "AND" with the bit of interest and verify if the
        result is non-zero (as shown in the example) to verify the desired status
        bit.

      @Preconditions
        UART1_Initializer function should have been called 
        before calling this function

      @Returns
        A UART1_STATUS value describing the current status 
        of the transfer.

            while(!(UART1_StatusGet & UART1_TX_COMPLETE ))
