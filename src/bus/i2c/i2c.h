    /**
        @Summary
            Inserts a list of i2c transaction requests into the i2c
            transaction queue.

        @Description
            The i2c processes lists of transaction requests.  Each transaction
            list is handled as a string of i2c restarts.  When the list of
            transactions is complete, an i2c stop is produced, the flag is set
            with the correct condition code and the next list is processed
            from the queue.

            This function inserts lists of requests prepared by the user
            application into the queue along with a pointer to the completion
            flag.

            The transaction is inserted into the list only if there is space
            in the list. If there is no space, the function exits with the
            flag set to I2C_MESSAGE_FAIL.

        @Preconditions
            None

        @Param
            count - The number of transaction requests in the trb_list.

        @Param
            *ptrb_list - A pointer to an array of transaction requests (TRB).
                See I2C_TRANSACTION_REQUEST_BLOCK definition for details.
