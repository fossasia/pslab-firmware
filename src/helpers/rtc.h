     * @brief Updates the time in DS1307 real-time clock

     * This command takes eight arguments over serial
     * 1. (uint8) seconds
     *    This 8-bit variable defines the second in time and it should have the
     *    following format and Clock Halt bit needs to be 0 for the RTC to work.
     *    | Clock Halt (1) | 10 Seconds (3) | Seconds (4) |
     * 2. (uint8) minutes
     *    This 8-bit variable defines the minute in time and it should have the
     *    following format. (Note: XX is a don't care bit)
     *    | XX (1) | 10 Minutes (3) | Minutes (4) |
     * 3. (uint8) hours
     *    This 8-bit variable defines the hour in time and it should have the
     *    following format. (Note: XX is a don't care bit)
     *    | XX (1) | 12/24 | AM/PM | 10h | Hours (4) |
     * 4. (uint8) day
     *    This 8-bit variable defines the week of the day (0 - Monday, ...) and
     *    it should have the following format. (Note: XX is a don't care bit)
     *    | XX (5) | Day (3) |
     * 5. (uint8) date
     *    This 8-bit variable defines the date in month and it should have the
     *    following format. (Note: XX is a don't care bit)
     *    | // XX (2) | 10 Dates (2) | Dates (4) |
     * 6. (uint8) month
     *    This 8-bit variable defines the month in year (0 - January, ...) and
     *    it should have the following format. (Note: XX is a don't care bit)
     *    | XX (3) | 10 Months (1) | Month (4) |
     * 7. (uint8) year
     *    This 8-bit variable defines the year (00 - 99) and it should have the
     *    following format.
     *    | 10 Years (4) | Year (4) |
     * 8. (uint8) control
     *    This is a control sequence to enable the SQR pin in DS1307 module and
     *    to power up the timing clock. We are not using the SQR functions. The
     *    MSB needs to be set to high to enable to clock.
