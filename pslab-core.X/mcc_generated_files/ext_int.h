  @Summary
    Initializes the external interrupt pins

  @Description
    This routine initializes the EXT_INT driver to detect the configured edge, clear
    the interrupt flag and enable the interrupt.

    The following external interrupts will be initialized:
 
  @Preconditions
    None.

  @Returns
    None.

  @Param
    None.

  @Example
    Initialize the external interrupt pins
    <code>
    EXT_INT_Initialize();
    </code>
