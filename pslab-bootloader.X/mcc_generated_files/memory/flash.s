/**
 * void FLASH_ErasePage(unsigned long address);
 * Erases the page containing the specified address. Be very careful if calling

 *
 * NOTE: This function can take upwards of 45ms on some device families and 
 * target pages to complete. At frequencies appreciably slower than the maximum 
 * device frequency, even longer may be required. Therefore, you may need to 
 * issue a ClrWdt() call before calling this function, assuming the Watchdog 
 * timer is enabled. This also means that you should not configure a watchdog 
 * timeout of less than ~64ms, even when you pre-clear the timeout. This 
 * function does NOT internally clear the watchdog for you as it is packaged as 
 * a library routine where not everyone would desire such behavior.
 *

 *                      to be erased. Must be page aligned.
