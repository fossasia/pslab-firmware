This repository contains firmware for the
[Pocket Science Lab (PSLab)](https://pslab.io) open hardware platform.
Hardware version 5 and 6 are supported.

## Pocket Science Lab

The PSLab provides an array of test and measurement instruments for doing
science and engineering experiments. Its built-in instruments include an
oscilloscope, a waveform generator, a frequency counter, programmable voltage
and current sources, and a logic analyzer. The PSLab also has UART, I2C, and SPI
buses, via which external devices can be connected and controlled.

The PSLab is a fully open device, and FOSSASIA provides a complete hardware
and software stack under open source licenses:

## Dependencies

The following tools are required to build the firmware:

- xc16 compiler
- cmake

## Building

This project is built with CMake. After cloning this repository, you must first
initialize and update the toolchain submodule:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

This will populate the `external/cmake-microchip` directory, after which the
firmware can be built:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

This will create a build artifact in the `build` directory:
`pslab-firmware.hex`.

## Flashing

The firmware can be flashed over USB or by using a programmer such as the
PICkit3.

### Over USB

Firmware can be flashed over USB if the device already has the
[bootloader](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-bootloader) installed.

Flashing the firmware requires the pslab-python library. See
[pslab-python](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-python) for installation
instructions.

Follow these steps to flash new firmware:

0. If using PSLab v5, see [Entering bootloader mode on PSLab v5](#entering-bootloader-mode-on-pslab-v5)

1. Press and hold the 'BOOT' button

2. Press the 'RESET' button
   1. The 'Status' LED should start blinking, indicating that the device is
      in bootloader mode

   2. Release the 'BOOT' button

3. Run `pslab flash --port <portname> firmware.hex`

4. After flashing is complete, reset or power cycle the device

### Using a programmer

> **Warning**
> If your device contains a bootloader, flashing just the firmware HEX with a
> programmer will OVERWRITE the bootloader. If for some reason you are unable
> to flash over USB, it is a better idea to first create a combined HEX file
> containing both the bootloader and the firmware and flash that, rather than
> flashing the pure firmare HEX. See the
> [bootloader repository](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-bootloader/#creating-a-combined-hex-file)
> for instructions on how to create a combined HEX.

Flashing with a programmer requires the mdb.sh script, which is distributed as
part of Microchip's MPLAB-X software suite. On Linux, the default installation
path for mdb.sh is `/opt/microchip/mplabx/<version>/mplab_platform/bin/mdb.sh`.
This script is used to run the file flash.mdbscript, located in the repository
root. Before following the below steps, you may need to modify flash.mdbscript
depending on which programmer you are using and the location of the firmware
HEX.

1. Disconnect the device from any power source
2. Connect the programmer to the device's ICSP header
3. Power on the device via USB
4. Run `mdb.sh flash.mdbscript`
5. Disconnect the programmer

### Entering bootloader mode on PSLab v5

The PSLab v5 lacks the BOOT button which is used to enter bootloader mode on
the v6. The pin which is connected to the BOOT button on the v6 is present,
however. It is therefore possible to enter bootloader mode on the v5 by
following these steps.

> **Note**
> The PSLab v5 does not come with the bootloader preinstalled. These steps
> will have no effect unless you have already installed the bootloader as
> described [here](https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-bootloader#flashing).

1. With the USB port to the top left of the board, the 5:th pin on the MCU's
   left side is the BOOT pin, counting from the top. Immediately below it
   (6:th from the top) is a conveniently located GND pin:
   ![How to enter bootloader on PSLab v5](docs/images/bootloader_v5.png)

2. Bridge these pins by touching both simultaneously with a small piece of
   metal, such as the tip of a jump wire or a paper clip.

3. Reset or power cycle the device. The v5 lacks a RESET button, but your can
   soft-reset it through `pslab-python`:

   ```python
   import pslab
   pslab.ScienceLab().reset()
   ```

4. The BOOT and GND pins must be bridged when the reset / power cycle happens.
   If you did it right the SYSTEM LED will start blinking, indicating that the
   PSLab is in bootloader mode.
