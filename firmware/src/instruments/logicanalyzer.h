/**
 * @brief Capture logic level changes on a single channel.
 *
 * @description
 * This routine will log timer values for the changes occurred in a pin defined 
 * by the configuration byte. 
 * 
 * If a trigger is enabled, this will use an external interrupt service routine 
 * attached to a pin defined by the trigger byte. Once the logic level is observed
 * to be the same as in EDGE bit, IC1 and IC2 modules will start the combined 
 * timer (32-bits) and pass them to BUFFER using first two DMA channels.
 * 
 * If no trigger is set, the timers will be started right away once the function
 * is called and logic level changes will logged referring to IC1 and IC2 capture 
 * timers in BUFFER using the same DMA channels.
 * 
 * This command function takes three arguments over serial:
 * 1. (uint16) number of data points to capture
 * 2. (uint8) trigger conditions:
 *            | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 |  1   | 0  |
 *            |  TRIGGER PIN  | X | X | EDGE | EN |
 *            PIN: Digital pin from map:
 *              0: LA1,
 *              1: LA2,
 *              2: LA3,
 *              3: LA4,

 *              5: SPI_CS,
 *              6: FREQ
 *            EDGE: Falling (1) or Rising (0) edge trigger
 *            EN: Enable trigger
 * 3. (uint8) channel and mode configurations:
 *            | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |
 *            |  DIGITAL PIN  |  TRANSITIONS  |
 *            CHANNEL: Digital pin from the same map as above `PIN` maps
 *            MODE: Logic transitions to capture. Refer `IC_PARAMS_CAPTURE_MODE`
 * 
 * The data captured from this method should be read using <TODO METHOD NAME>
 * 
 * It returns nothing over serial.
 * It sends an acknowledge byte (SUCCESS).

 * pin defined by the trigger byte and an ISR will be activated for IC4 module.
 * This will trigger an interrupt when a logic change defined by the trigger byte
 * is observed at the pin attached to IC4. At the same time, IC1 and IC2 start
 * their timers and log timer values to BUFFER using DMA0 and DMA1 channels
